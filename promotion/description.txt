FullSync publishes and updates websites, synchronizes local dirs or backs up data. special features are configuration per dir, buffered filesystems (so the tools only sees files it created itself), multiple protocols (FTP, SFTP...) and flexible rules.


--==[a lot chars]==-----------------------

FullSync is a powerful tool that helps you keep multiple copies of various data in sync. It can update your Website using FTP or SFTP, backup your data on the local disk or refresh a working copy from a remote server on your local drive, and much more. It features multiple protocol support, flexible rules, a scheduler, and many other features that give you a solid basis for nearly all situations.


--==[very long, not really good]==--------

The tools should provide a flexible way to synchronize various formes of file masses. a graphical interface is only planned for configuration and visible logging but not for comparing the two sides. the synchronization process should be pretty silent (except logging) and fast.
the most interesting feature for updating websites is that the target information can be buffered. that means the program knows which files it uploaded, their size, lastmodified date and maybe a checksum. multiple advantages arise:
 - comparing by lastmodified date is hard when using ftp, because there is no way to set the date on the remote file (?)
 - comparing by size is hard because of the different linebreaks.
 - if you create a new file on the server (like configuration or a datafile) it will be ignored because the tool doesn't know about it, it just looks at the list of self-uploaded files. this way it is possible to sync important files and ignore the rest.

of course buffering is just an option. 
additional features is a good configuration which can be changed per-directory using .syncrules files (just like apache with it's .htaccess files)
the tool will also be usable as backup program, because the needs are pretty similar and i already made one which was used to rewrite this tool ;)
