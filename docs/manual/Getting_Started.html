							We will start creating a simple profile which updates a destination directory
							with changes in the source directory. For example, this is useful for updating
							websites on remote locations with changes that were done on the local working
							copy. Additionally, we will make the profile executed at specific times.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							First, you need to create a new and empty profile. You will now see an empty
							<a href="Windows_ProfileDetails.html">Profile Details Window</a>. After entering
							a name you have to specify the source and destination locations. As source
							we will use a local directory, so you can use the browse button. The destination
							will be an ftp url, which should look like this: 
							<code>ftp://your.domain.com/relative/path</code> where the 'relative path' is the
							path needed to navigate to the destination path after logging in. So if you are
							unsure what to enter, simply connect to the ftp site with your standard ftp
							tool and find out what lies between the startup (default) directory and the
							directory you want to be the destination. After that, enter the username and password.
							Alternatively you can also specify a local path again, if you want to.
							path as well.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Now that the source and destination are given you will need to define in which
							way you want those two locations synchronized. In this example we will use
							Publish/Update, which will synchronize in just one direction, from source to 
							destination, as most of the currently provided types do.
							Alternatively you can use Backup Copy or Exact Copy which have slightly different
							behaviours that are shortly described in a text besides. 
							</p>

							<p>
							The last thing is defining the ruleset. Simply select the simple rule set, activate
							"Sync Subdirectories" and that's it. (<a href="RuleSets.html">More information</a>)
							</p>

							<p>
							Now you can press "ok" and run the profile. To additionally specify a scheduled
							execution, simply edit the profile and select "Edit Scheduling". If you are used
							to crontabs you can specify a crontab-like scheduling, or simply take the interval
							execution. After accepting the new scheduling, enable this profile for scheduled
							execution by checking the "Enabled" option and press "ok". If you now enable the
							scheduler by pressing the run button in the toolbar all scheduled projects will
							be executed at their specific times.
