							You can synchronize two locations using one of the following
							supported types::<br><br>
							<dl>
								<dt>Publish/Update</dt>
								<dd>
								This is used to update a website from a local copy to a remote server. 
								It will apply changes to the destination but not the other way around. If a file
								changed in the destination a warning will be generated so it is not overwritten
								without your knowledge. Additional files in the destination will be ignored, deleted
								files in source will also be deleted on the destination. Short: FullSync creates
								an exact copy of the source and keeps track of what it uploaded so additional files 
								(like generated data or config files) in destination are not affected.<br><br>
								</dd>
								<dt>Backup Copy</dt>
								<dd>
								Copies all changes in the source to destination but does not delete anything in
								destination.<br><br>
								</dd>
								<dt>Exact Copy</dt>
								<dd>
								Copies all changes in the source to destination including deletions.<br><br>
								</dd>
								<dt>Two-Way Synchronization</dt>
								<dd>
								Compares two locations and copies newer files to the other side. <br>
								BEWARE: it does not recognize changes on both sides! in this case, 
								the older file is overwritten and changes to it are lost!
								<br><br>
								</dd>
