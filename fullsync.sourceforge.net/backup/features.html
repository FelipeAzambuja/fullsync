							<dl>
								<dt>Publication and update of websites, synchronization of local directories and making backups of your data.</dt>
								<dd>Because of the large amount of options provided, you can use FullSync to publish
									and update websites, synchronize files between your pc and your notebook or even 
									backup files to a storage device every few hours.<br/><br/></dd>
								<dt>multiple modes: update destination, synchronize source with destination</dt>
								<dd>FullSync can be configured to look for changes in different ways. you can
									decide to make it look only on source changes, or both, source and destination
									or only on the destination. Additionally you can decide whether deletions should
									be performed or just reported.<br/><br/></dd>
								<dt>flexible rules, allowing all kinds of exclusion/inclusion</dt>
								<dd>The rules that can be defined are very powerful. for example pattern matches
									can be regular expressions and you can first tell FullSync which files to take
									and can then define exceptions. Additional you can configure the criterias
									which decide whether a file has changed or not. this is good when using 
									filesystems which can hardly set modification times or where the size changes
									while transferring from the source to destination.<br/><br/></dd>					
								<dt>configuration and rule-rewriting per directory possible</dt>
								<dd>For advanced configuration you can deploy xml files in the synchronized
									paths which can overwrite the rules for this branch. So you could for example
									change the synchronization direction for a single directory, or you could
									change filters or even disallow rule rewriting.<br/><br/></dd>
								<dt>buffered filesystems (so the tool only sees files it created itself)</dt>
								<dd>To allow updating just the important parts or a directory tree, FullSync 
									can buffer the view of the destination filesystem and keeps track which
									files it transferred. This way additional files on the destination are ignored and
									changes on destination files can be reported. Reporting or finding changes
									will be implemented for the source later.<br/><br/></dd>
								<dt>multiple protocols (FTP,SFTP...)</dt>
								<dd>The structure of FullSync makes it easy for a developer to a new type of
									filesystem, which can be used as source or destination in the synchronization process.
									Currently local files and ftp is supported.<br/><br/></dd>
								<dt>read/write access bufferable and multithreadable</dt>
								<dd>The way the file data is copied is very customizable. this allows to use a
									Buffer which loads large masses of source data into the memory and writes
									it all in one run if the buffer is full. that reduces harddisk-jumps and is especially
									good for making backups or synchronizations on one harddisk. for updating webpages
									multithreaded writing is good for using full bandwidth.<br/><br/></dd>
