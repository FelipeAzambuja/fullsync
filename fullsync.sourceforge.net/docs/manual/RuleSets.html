							<p>
							Currently there are two kinds of rule sets supported: simple 
							rule sets and advanced rule sets.
							</p><br>
							
							<p>
							For basic operations the <b>simple rule set</b> is enough, it allows 
							you to define ignore and accept patterns (actually regular 
							expressions) and will operate in a default way.<br><br>
							So a simple regular expression for matching specific file endings looks
							like this: <code>.+\.txt</code> or <code>.+\.(txt|jpg|tmp)</code> (for
							matching multiple endings).<br>
							If you just want to match complete file/directory names use this: 
							<code>DirectoryName</code> or for multiple names 
							<code>(DirectoryName1|DirectoryName2|file\.extension)</code>. 
							To match just the beginning or ending use the following, which is quite
							much the same as matching endings: <code>prefix.+</code> or 
							<code>.+suffix</code> (note: + means there must be at least one character.
							use * instead to make it match no character as well.).<br>
							Until there is a more userfriendly way available, please use google 
							to find out more about regular expressions.
							</p><br>
							
							<p>
							<b>Advanced rule sets</b> allow you to set rules more detailed,
							like setting compare conditions, allowing deletion and it
							allows you to overwrite these rules in each directory using
							special files. At the moment, the format of the file is very
							old and there are many options no longer supported, but still
							you have the possibilty to overwrite ignore and accept patterns
							per directory. To use the advanced rule set, simply copy the
							sample.syncrules file to your source directory and rename it
							to .syncrules (on windows you may need to use an editor or some
							other filemanager to do this as the explorer does not like
							names beginning with a dot). This will be the initial rule set
							file containing one rule set named "UPLOAD". this must be named
							in the advanced rule set options of the profile. To overwrite
							ignore or accept (former "take") rules, just put a file called
							.syncrules into the directory and copy the start and end rule set
							lines into the file. now you can define a new ignore rule by
							adding a line <code>DEFINE IGNORE "&lt;pattern&gt;"</code>.
