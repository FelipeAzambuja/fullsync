WARNING

	This is a preview release! there are know bugs and many things
	aren't really tested. use this software on your own risk.
	

RESTRICTIONS
	
	Because it is a lot shorter to mention the things that work
	then the things that are missing, here are the things you
	can try and which should work "ok":

	publish and update

	for example you can publish your website that is locally 
	stored to a remote site and update all local changes 
	(add/delete/modify) to the remote site. 
	if a file is remotely changed you will be notified. 
	additional files in the destination will be ignored as long as
	there are no matching files in the source.

	this works only with destination buffering,
	source buffering will result in no actions.

	you can specify file, ftp and sftp urls.


HOW TO SET UP SYNCHRONIZATION

	You need the source directory (best it's local, haven't tested
	ftp or sftp source locations, yet).

	You need a destination directory. it's best to use an empty
	one as buffer initialization is not working yet, so fullsync
	will not accept the files as the right ones. 

	Now put the sample.syncrules into the source directory and name
	it .syncrules. this file will tell fullsync which files to 
	synchronize and configures some special rules. The sample file 
	is good enough for a simple publish/update. it will look for more 
	rule files only at the source, recursed through directories, uses 
	ignore and take rules and allows deletion at destination. normally 
	this ruleset will accept any file, except it matches to an ignore 
	rule, except if matches to an take rule. that means "take" is used
	to specify exceptions that should not be ignored. in this case
	all files beginning with a dot will be ignored, except the
	rules files which will be copied to the destination.

	The next and final step is to set up a profile in FullSync.
	Just click the add profile button and specify the data requested.
	The profile name is your choice, source and destination are
	urls which should look like this:
		file:/E:/some/path
		file:/home/mypath
		ftp://yourdomain.com/some/path
		sftp://yourdomain.com/some/path

	enable buffering at the destination and type in authentification
	data where needed. your password is stored encryped on the drive.
	if you use the sample rules file you should use UPLOAD in the
	ruleset field as all the rules in our file apply to the 
	ruleset "UPLOAD".

	if you now run the profile hopefully a new window appears with the
	actions that might be done. you can change the actions by right-
	clicking them and choosing another one. be aware that this might
	result in bad behaviour so be careful changing too many things 
	there. for example if you choose "Ignore" where a directory was
	created before, the files within can not be properly written and
	an exception may occur. if you can, prefer doing the needed changes
	yourself and rerun the profile.

	Keep in mind that it is a preview release, so there might happen
	some strange things. also there is no need to inform me about
	bugs yet as i know that there are still a lot in there and i don't
	have problems finding them, yet :).
